<h1> A Little About My Site </h1>

Building this site was a side project for me while I go to school. I built this site entirely myself, using Jekyll. It introduced me to the Ruby programming language and how to use GitHub through my command line.
<br>
A copy of this site is available on my GitHub repository, wilsons-private-vault. I built this site with Jekyll's default template, Minima. I give permission for anyone to use my template on their Jekyll site. If you want to build a site and use my template, just follow Jekyll's documentation and grab a copy of my site to use as a template.
