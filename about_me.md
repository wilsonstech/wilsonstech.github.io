## A Bit About Myself

I am a upcomeing Graduate in cybersecurity on a journey to become a penetration tester. My focus is on making digital spaces more secure by finding and fixing vulnerabilities.

I love animals, I have a 3 year old goldendoodle his name is wilson, we spend alot of going hikeing thru various trails and geocaching, I also enjoy fly fishing, a fun challenge compared to normal fishing. When im not outdoors I like to spend alot of time working on various projects on my computer, I really have a love for programming and enjoy useing my raspberry pi and creating diffrent programs or diffrent projects.
