      I am an upcoming graduate in cybersecurity with a dedicated focus on becoming a penetration tester. My passion lies in identifying and addressing vulnerabilities across the digital landscape.

    <p>
      In addition to my academic pursuits, I am an avid animal lover, proud owner of a 3-year-old goldendoodle. During my free time, you'll often find us exploring local parks and enjoying the scenic trails in our community.

      I am deeply engaged in refining my technical skills. I dedicate substantial time to diverse computer projects, utilizing my passion for programming. My exploration includes leveraging advanced technologies such as the Raspberry Pi, where I actively contribute to the creation of innovative programs and projects.
