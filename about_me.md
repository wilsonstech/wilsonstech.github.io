<h1> A Bit About Myself </h1>

I am an upcoming graduate in cybersecurity with a dedicated focus on becoming a penetration tester. My passion lies in identifying and addressing vulnerabilities across the digital landscape.
<br><br>
In addition to my academic pursuits, I am an avid animal lover, proud owner of a 3-year-old goldendoodle named Wilson. During my free time, you'll often find us exploring local parks and enjoying the scenic trails in our community.
<br><br>
I am deeply engaged in refining my technical skills. I dedicate substantial time to diverse computer projects, utilizing my passion for programming. My exploration includes leveraging advanced technologies such as the Raspberry Pi, where I actively contribute to the creation of innovative programs and projects.

## Community Involvement

Outside cybersecurity, I'm an active member of various communities. Here are just a few of my favorites I love giving back to.

**Zooniverse -** a citizen science web portal owned and operated by the Citizen Science Alliance. It is home to some of the Internet's largest, most popular, and most successful citizen science projects.

**Einstein@home -** a volunteer computing project that searches for signals from spinning neutron stars in data from gravitational-wave detectors
