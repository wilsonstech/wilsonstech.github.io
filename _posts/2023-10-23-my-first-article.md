Welcome to my first article on cybersecurity! In this article, we'll explore some basic principles of network security.

Network security is a critical aspect of cybersecurity. It involves protecting the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data and resources within a network. One fundamental concept in network security is the use of firewalls.

A **firewall** is a network security device or software that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization's previously established security policies. Firewalls act as a barrier between a trusted network (such as your local network) and untrusted networks (such as the internet).

Here's an example of a simple firewall rule in **iptables**, a commonly used firewall tool in Linux:

```markdown
# Allow incoming traffic on port 80 (HTTP)
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
```
